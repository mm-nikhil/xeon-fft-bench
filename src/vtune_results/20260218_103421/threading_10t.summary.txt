    Spin and Overhead Time: 25.528s (32.3% of CPU Time)
     | The threading runtime function related to time spent on imbalance or
     | serial spinning consumed a significant amount of CPU time. This can be
     | caused by a load imbalance, insufficient concurrency for all working
     | threads, or busy waits of worker threads while serial code is executed.
     | If there is an imbalance, apply dynamic work scheduling or reduce the
     | size of work chunks or tasks. If there is insufficient concurrency,
     | consider collapsing the outer and inner loops. If there is a wait for
     | completion of serial code, explore options for parallelization with Intel
     | Advisor, algorithm, or microarchitecture tuning of the application's
     | serial code with VTune Profiler Basic Hotspots or Microarchitecture
     | Exploration analysis respectively. For OpenMP* applications, use the Per-
     | Barrier OpenMP Potential Gain metric set in the HPC Performance
     | Characterization analysis to discover the reason for high imbalance or
     | serial spin time.
